* Initial Hackage/Cabal release.
  Version set to 2.4 to distinguish from the 2.3 (non-cabal) release on my home page.

3.0
---
* Included MasterTable.txt in the distro.
* Eq and Ord Instances now based on strict structural equality (derived)
* Exposed height related functions

3.1
---
* Exposed BinPath primitives.
* Removed AVL tree based sorts.
* Removed Data.Map/Set conversions. This eliminates the containers package dependency.
* Removed link to Haskell wiki homepage as this will never be done.

3.2
---
No code changes, just reclaiming ownership and bumping version No.

* Changed to derived Read/Show instances (instead of via lists).
  Hence the instances are incompatible with earlier versions.

   genVennMaybe,testGenVennMaybe
   genVennToList,

   genVennMaybeToList
   genVennMaybeAsList
